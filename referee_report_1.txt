Eq. (5) leads directly to Eq. (11) via the substitutions (6)-(10). Eq. (12)
is the reduced, approximate form of (11). We have cleaned up the wording in
this section to make things clearer.

We had indeed overlooked defining \tau. We have now added the definition
of \tau, and renamed the period of cyclic variations from \tau to T to
avoid confusion.

We have also added a paragraph at the end of Section 3 clearly explaining
our definition of number squeezing in the multimode case, and refer to this
definition in the caption of Figure 4.

We thank the referee for bring this reference to our attention, and we have
added it to our paper.
